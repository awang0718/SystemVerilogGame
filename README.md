# SystemVerilogGame

The purpose of this lab is to create a 2D side-scrolling fighting game. The goal of this game is to eliminate all the enemies without dying. We will use the keyboard as an input to the game, with the C interface from Lab 8. We will also display the game on the monitor using a VGA. We will have edge detection for the platforms so that the enemy and the player cannot pass through the platforms. We will have sprites for the player, enemies, and the ground. There will be an attack mechanic, player health, shield mechanic, and jumping. Enemies will also have health. The player and enemy will also take damage from each other based off of hit boxes. The sprite of the player also changes when all health is gone and will be unable to move. All code other than the usb interface will be done in SystemVerilog. There will be basic animation for the player and the enemy.
